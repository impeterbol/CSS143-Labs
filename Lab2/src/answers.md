Why did we do so much copying-and-pasting in our software above?

How can this approach be problematic?

Are there obvious improvements that could be made here with respect the software design for Squares and Circles?

What programming constructs were you familiar with, and which did you need to look up?

Assume we used a separate array for Squares and for Circles rather than one unifying Object array.
How would this complicate the task of adding a new Shape (say, a Triangle) to our ObjectList class?
